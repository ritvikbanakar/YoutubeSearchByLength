# Youtube Search By Length

As I browsed on Youtube, I realized that the only option Youtube has for the length of videos is either showing only short videos (less than 4 minutes) or long videos (more than 20 minutes). Then I realized that I could utilize the Youtube API for Python and create a program that would search for videos and sort them by their length. Quite a simple program but with an effective feature. 

Features Coming Soon:
1. Ability to sort by other criteria that Youtube already has
2. Being able to sort videos that are on a creator's channel

Watch out for daily queries per day as you only have 10,000 a day
